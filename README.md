# Student-Performance-Analysis
Project for analyzing student performance data

## Overview
This project analyzes student performance data to understand overall academic achievement, the impact of absences, and gender differences.

## Tools Used
- Excel for data cleaning and preparation  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for statistical analysis and data visualization  
- Tableau for creating interactive dashboards  

## Key Findings
- Average scores per subject  
- Impact of absences on student performance  
- Gender-based performance analysis  

## How to Run
1. Open the Python notebook file `student_performance_1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.  
2. Place the data file `cleaned_data (1).csv` in the same folder as the notebook.  
3. Run the notebook cells to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.  
4. Open the Tableau dashboard file `ŸçStudent Performance.twbx` using Tableau Desktop to explore the interactive reports.
